# Demultiplexing of Patient Samples

In this project, I've reanalyzed the data generated from the published paper https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1603-1.

The published paper is saved in the 'Paper' folder.    
The Rmd and html scripts are saved in the 'Script' folder.    
The figures generated from the script are saved in the 'Figures' folder.
