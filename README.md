# Demultiplexing of Patient Samples

In this project, I've reanalyzed the data generated from the published paper https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1603-1.

The published paper is saved in the 'Paper' folder.    
The Rmd and html scripts are saved in the 'Script' folder.    
The figures generated from the script are saved in the 'Figures' folder.

The authors of this paper introduce a new method for scRNA-seq multiplexing, where cells are labeled with sample-specific oligonucleotide tagged antibodies (HTOs) for downstream demultiplexing. In their proof-of-principle experiments, they obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from eight separate human donors (donors labelled A through H)
